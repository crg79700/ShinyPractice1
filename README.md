My first few attempts at predictive shiny apps based off one of my dissertation data sets.

Cognitive Function scores are standard scores obtained via CNS Vital Signs. I had measured more cognitive tests that the ones 
below, but I removed them from this data set due to multicollinearity issues

Cognitive Functions measured are as follows:

EF = Executive Function

MOTS = Motor Speed

SIMATTN = Simple Attention

COMATTN = Complex Attention

WM = Working Memory

PS = Processing Speed

RT = Reaction Time
